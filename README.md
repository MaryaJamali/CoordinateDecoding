## Description:
This program is a complement to the program called `CoordinateCoding`. In this program, we give the coded coordinates to the program along the lines of X and Y, and during the operation, it displays and decodes the original coordinates.
## Fix and update:
Currently, no corrections are going to be made in this program, but I welcome criticism and suggestions for the development of this program, and I appreciate you in advance, my dear friend.
